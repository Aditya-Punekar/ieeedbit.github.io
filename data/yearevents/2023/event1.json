  "date": "13th-14th March 2023",
  
  "description": " About Satellite Workshop : CanSat is a simulation of a real satellite, integrated within the volume and shape of a can.  We will also launch the amateur solid propellent rocket which will go up to an altitude of around 200 feets.Following things students will do as a part of the workshop : 1] To fit all major subsystems found in a satellite, including power, sensors, and communications, into the volume and shape of a can . 2] To provide a parachute to ensure the can survives the landing. 3] To carry out scientific experiments and  transmit in-flight data to an Earth-based computer. Benefits  : 1]    Students will learn about rocket technology. 2] Students will learn about electronics, sensors, soldering, programming, interfacing, etc. 3]They will learn about how to make a structure as per the parameters defined for the satellite.                                                Certificates to all participants signed by NASA expert. .. Students/one group must have one laptop for programming",
