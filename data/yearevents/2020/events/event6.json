    "date": "3rd, 4th,5th and 6th September 2019.",
    "description" : "The session started by briefing the students with an introductory presentation about FPGA and its various applications, advantages and disadvantages.Finally the session was taken over by Ms.Lakshmi .V, who conducted the most of the Hands on training workshop. To start with the difference between FPGA , ASIC and microcontrollers and how FPGA is better and reliable was explained. The coding language i.e VHDL/ Verilog was then,explained in detail along with examples of various code. Coding of various logic gates and other combinational circuits using Xilinx software was then taught to the students in the first session.",
